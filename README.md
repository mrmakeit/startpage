## Edits

This repo introduces a few minor changes.

1. DuckDuckGo - Changes the search engine used to DuckDuckGo
1. Autofocus - Since using a NewTab plugin causes the URL bar to be filled, this makes searching feel more vanilla.

## Demo

You can try the startpage here at [github pages](https://mrmakeit.github.io/startpage/) or on viktorkare's [personal site](https://start.theviktor.com).

## Install

- Download the files
